# Personal Diary Application

**Personal Diary Application** is a simple command-line diary tool designed to allow users to record, view, and generate an HTML summary of their diary entries. This project serves as a basic proof-of-concept for practicing Python programming and object-oriented design. I intend to expand the usability of this tool as I get more time as of right now this is just a skeleton.
